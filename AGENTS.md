These are the md files that you should read:

- DIOXUS.md If you have to do anything with dioxus
- LIVING_PLAN.md this defines all the phases of the project
- PROJECT.md this explains what the project is supposed to do
- WIREFRAMES.md this explains what the project is supposed to look like

If you are implementing a design feature, follow the guidelines in the WIREFRAMES.md file.

At the beginning of each step ask questions if you are unsure about the requirements or implementation details.
