# Coding Standards & Best Practices

Universal coding standards applicable across all projects.

## Code Quality Principles

### 1. Readability First
- Code is read more than written
- Clear variable and function names
- Self-documenting code preferred over comments
- Consistent formatting

### 2. KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
- Simplest solution that works
- Avoid over-engineering
- No premature optimization
- Easy to understand > clever code

### 3. DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Extract common logic into functions
- Create reusable components
- Share utilities across modules
- Avoid copy-paste programming

### 4. YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)
- Don't build features before they're needed
- Avoid speculative generality
- Add complexity only when required
- Start simple, refactor when needed

## Comments & Documentation

### When to Comment

```typescript
// ✅ GOOD: Explain WHY, not WHAT
// Use exponential backoff to avoid overwhelming the API during outages
const delay = Math.min(1000 * Math.pow(2, retryCount), 30000)

// Deliberately using mutation here for performance with large arrays
items.push(newItem)

// ❌ BAD: Stating the obvious
// Increment counter by 1
count++

// Set name to user's name
name = user.name
```

**Remember**: Code quality is not negotiable. Clear, maintainable code enables rapid development and confident refactoring.
